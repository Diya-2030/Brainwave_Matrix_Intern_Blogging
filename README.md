This project is a part of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions, where I worked as a Web Development Intern from January 2025. The objective of this task was to develop a responsive and user-friendly Blogging Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository showcases my progress, learning, and contributions to frontend development during the internship.

HTML5 – for structuring the content

CSS3 – for styling, layout, and animations

JavaScript – for enhancing user experience with dynamic behavior

Netlify – for deploying the website live
